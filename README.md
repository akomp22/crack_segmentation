unet which detect cracks with varying scale.

## Data
Basic data consists of images taken during fatigue test of metal specimens which were held in National Aviation University (Ukraine). During fatigue test, specimens was captured with specified time interval. Result of each specimen test is row of images with gradualy growing crack. Images for each specimen was preprocessed so that crack highlited on basic of dynamical changes on each image row.
